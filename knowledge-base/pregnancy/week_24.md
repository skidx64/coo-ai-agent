# Your Pregnancy: Week 24 Guide

## Your Baby This Week
Your little one is growing more active every day! At this stage, your baby is about the size of a cantaloupe and is developing facial features that become more distinct each week. Their skin is still translucent, but they're gradually putting on more body fat, and their movements are becoming more coordinated.

## Your Body This Week
You're likely feeling those wonderful baby kicks more regularly now, especially when you're resting. Your growing bump might be causing some lower back discomfort as your body adjusts to carrying the extra weight. Many women notice their belly button starting to protrude around this time – a completely normal change during pregnancy.

## This Week's To-Do
* Schedule your glucose screening test if you haven't already – it's typically done between 24-28 weeks
* Start researching childbirth classes in your area or online options
* Begin planning your nursery layout and making a list of essential items

## Tips for Partners
This is a great time to step up and help with physical tasks that might be becoming more challenging for the expecting mom. Consider taking over more household duties that require bending or heavy lifting. Also, this is an ideal time to attend prenatal appointments together – your presence and support mean more than you know.

## Wellness Corner
* Stay hydrated by keeping a water bottle nearby throughout the day
* Practice good posture to help minimize back strain
* Take regular breaks if you work at a desk, and try gentle stretching

## Looking Ahead
You're entering the latter part of your second trimester, often considered the "golden period" of pregnancy. Many parents find this an ideal time to start planning for the baby's arrival while energy levels are typically good and morning sickness has usually subsided.

Remember: Every pregnancy is unique, and what you're experiencing is your own special journey. If you have specific concerns, always reach out to your healthcare provider for personalized advice.
