# Your Pregnancy: Week 27 Guide

Welcome to week 27! You're entering the final stretch of your second trimester, and there are exciting developments happening for both you and your little one. Let's explore what's new this week.

## Your Baby This Week
Your precious little one is growing more active and aware each day. At this stage, your baby can open and close their eyes, and they're developing regular sleep and wake cycles. They're about the size of a head of cauliflower now, and their brain is growing rapidly as they process more sensations from the world around them.

## Your Body This Week
You might notice your belly button becoming more prominent as your uterus continues to expand upward. Many women experience increased back pain and heartburn during this time as the growing baby puts pressure on different parts of the body. Remember that these discomforts are temporary and completely normal as your body makes room for your growing little one.

## This Week's To-Do
* Schedule your glucose screening test if you haven't already
* Start researching childbirth classes in your area
* Begin planning your maternity leave arrangements with your employer

## Tips for Partners
Now is a wonderful time to become more involved in the pregnancy journey. Try reading or singing to the baby - they can hear voices from outside the womb! Also, offering regular back massages can help relieve some of your pregnant partner's discomfort, especially in the evening hours.

## Wellness Corner
Remember to:
* Stay hydrated (aim for 8-10 glasses of water daily)
* Take regular breaks if you're sitting for long periods
* Continue your approved pregnancy exercises
* Listen to your body and rest when needed

This is an exciting time as you prepare to enter your third trimester. Every day brings you closer to meeting your little one, and you're doing a fantastic job growing this precious new life.
