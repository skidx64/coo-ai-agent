# Week 14 of Your Pregnancy Journey

## Your Baby This Week
Your little one is growing more active every day! At about the size of a lemon, your baby is developing fine facial features and can now make expressions. Their tiny body is covered in a fine, protective hair called lanugo, and they're practicing lots of movements like stretching and wiggling their fingers and toes.

## Your Body This Week
Many moms find the second trimester brings welcome relief from early pregnancy symptoms. You might notice your energy levels improving and morning sickness fading away. While you may not be obviously showing yet, you might start feeling more comfortable in maternity clothes as your regular clothes get snugger around the middle.

## This Week's To-Do
* Schedule your upcoming prenatal appointments if you haven't already
* Start a gentle pregnancy exercise routine (after checking with your healthcare provider)
* Begin researching childbirth classes in your area - it's not too early to sign up

## Tips for Partners
This is a great time to get more involved in the pregnancy journey! Help research and compare childbirth classes you can attend together. Since mom's energy might be returning, plan some special activities or date nights to celebrate this more comfortable phase of pregnancy.

## Good to Know
At 14 weeks, you're well into your second trimester, often called the "honeymoon phase" of pregnancy. Take advantage of this typically more comfortable time to prepare for the exciting months ahead. Remember that every pregnancy is different, so don't worry if your experience doesn't match exactly what you read - your healthcare provider is always your best resource for specific concerns.

## Self-Care Corner
* Stay hydrated with water throughout the day
* Try pregnancy-safe stretches to ease any body aches
* Get plenty of rest, even if you're feeling more energetic

Remember that you're doing an amazing job growing your little one. Take time to celebrate each milestone and connect with your changing body and developing baby.
