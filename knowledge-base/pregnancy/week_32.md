# Your Pregnancy: Week 32

## Your Baby This Week
Your little one is getting stronger every day! At this stage, your baby is about the size of a large jicama and continues to put on weight, developing those adorable chubby cheeks and dimpled limbs. Your baby's movements might feel different now as space gets tighter in the womb, but they're still practicing important skills like sucking, breathing, and grasping.

## Your Body This Week
You're in the homestretch now, and your body is working hard to support your growing baby. You might notice your bump getting more prominent as your little one continues to gain weight, and you may feel some pressure on your ribs and pelvis. Don't be surprised if you're experiencing more frequent Braxton Hicks contractions – these "practice" contractions are helping your body prepare for the real thing.

## This Week's To-Do
* Start packing your hospital bag if you haven't already – include comfort items, essential documents, and a going-home outfit for baby
* Schedule your 32-week prenatal checkup if you haven't yet
* Begin practicing relaxation techniques for labor, such as deep breathing or visualization

## Tips for Partners
Now's a great time to step up your support game! Help your pregnant partner stay comfortable by offering back rubs or foot massages, especially in the evening when discomfort tends to peak. Take the initiative to handle more household tasks, particularly ones that require bending or heavy lifting.

## Remember
Every pregnancy is unique, and you're doing a fantastic job growing your little one. Don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider with any concerns – that's what they're there for! Keep taking things one day at a time and remember to celebrate these precious moments as you prepare to meet your baby.
