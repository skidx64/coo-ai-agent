# A Parent's Guide to Newborn Care
*A practical handbook for the first weeks*

## What Is Normal for a Newborn?
Newborns require constant attention and care during their first weeks of life. They typically:
- Sleep 16-17 hours per day in short periods
- Need feeding every 2-3 hours
- Have 6-8 wet diapers daily
- Gradually become more alert and responsive

## Basic Daily Care

### Feeding
- Feed on demand (usually every 2-3 hours)
- Watch for feeding cues (rooting, sucking motions)
- Ensure proper latching if breastfeeding
- Keep track of feeding times and wet diapers

### Sleep Safety
- Always place baby on back to sleep
- Use firm mattress with fitted sheet only
- Keep crib free of blankets, pillows, and toys
- Maintain room temperature around 68-72°F

### Hygiene
- Change diapers frequently
- Clean gently during diaper changes
- Give sponge baths until umbilical cord falls off
- Use mild, fragrance-free products

## When to Call the Doctor
Seek immediate medical attention if your baby:
- Has a fever over 100.4°F
- Shows signs of dehydration
- Has difficulty breathing
- Appears unusually lethargic
- Has fewer wet diapers than normal
- Shows signs of jaundice (yellow skin)

## Prevention Tips
1. Wash hands frequently
2. Keep vaccinations up to date
3. Avoid sick visitors
4. Maintain a clean environment
5. Never shake a baby
6. Support head and neck when holding

## Getting Support
- Schedule regular pediatrician visits
- Join new parent support groups
- Accept help from family and friends
- Rest when baby sleeps
- Don't hesitate to ask questions

Remember: Every baby is different, and it takes time to develop a routine. Trust your instincts, but don't hesitate to seek professional guidance when needed.
