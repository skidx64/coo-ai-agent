# A Parent's Guide to Infant & Toddler Nutrition

## What It Is
Infant and toddler nutrition refers to feeding your baby the right foods at the right time to support healthy growth and development. It starts with either breast milk or formula and gradually includes solid foods as your baby grows.

## What Your Baby Needs at Different Ages
**0-6 months:**
- Breast milk or infant formula only
- No other foods or drinks needed

**Around 6 months:**
- Continue breast milk/formula
- Begin introducing solid foods
- Start with single-ingredient foods
- Wait 3-5 days between new foods to watch for reactions

## What You Can Do at Home
**Safe Feeding Practices:**
- Feed on demand for infants
- Hold baby upright during feeding
- Start with thin purées
- Gradually increase texture as baby develops
- Offer small amounts of water in a cup from 6 months

**First Foods to Try:**
- Iron-fortified infant cereals
- Puréed vegetables
- Puréed fruits
- Soft, mashed proteins (after checking with pediatrician)

## When to Call the Doctor
**Contact your pediatrician if your baby:**
- Shows signs of allergic reaction (rash, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Has difficulty swallowing
- Refuses several feedings
- Shows signs of dehydration
- Has significant changes in feeding patterns

## Prevention & Safety Tips
**DO NOT give:**
- Honey before age 1 (risk of botulism)
- Cow's milk before age 1
- Unpasteurized foods or drinks
- Foods that pose choking hazards
- Fruit juice before 12 months

**Special Considerations:**
- For babies with eczema or family history of allergies, consult your doctor about introducing potential allergens
- Always supervise feeding times
- Avoid propping bottles
- Never force-feed
- Create a calm feeding environment

Remember: Every baby develops differently. What works for one may not work for another. Stay in regular communication with your healthcare provider about your baby's specific nutritional needs.
