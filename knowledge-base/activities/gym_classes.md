* Build strong foundations in balance and coordination that benefit all future sports
* Develop body awareness and confidence at a crucial age
* Learn to follow directions and work with others in a structured environment

## When to Start
The good news is, it's never too early! Children as young as 12 months can begin parent-toddler classes. These early experiences lay the groundwork for a lifetime of physical activity and body confidence.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Slow**
   Don't rush into too many classes too soon. Once weekly is perfect for beginners, allowing them to build confidence without becoming overwhelmed.

2. **Dress for Success**
   * Comfortable, fitted clothing
   * No loose jewelry
   * Hair secured away from face
   * Bare feet or gymnastics shoes

3. **Keep it Fun**
   Remember that at these young ages, the goal is to build a positive relationship with physical activity. Celebrate effort and participation rather than focusing on perfect form or competition.

Remember: Every child develops at their own pace. Choose a program that matches your child's personality and development level, and don't hesitate to try different classes or instructors until you find the right fit.
