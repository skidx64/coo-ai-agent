*Remember: Every child develops at their own unique pace! This guide describes typical milestones most children reach by age 3.*

## What Your Little One Might Be Doing

**Social & Emotional**
- Settles down within 10 minutes at daycare drop-off
- Shows interest in playing with other children
- Takes turns during simple games
- Shows a wide range of emotions

**Language & Communication**
- Engages in short back-and-forth conversations
- Asks lots of questions (especially "who," "what," "where")
- Uses simple sentences to express needs
- Follows basic two-step instructions

**Movement & Physical Skills**
- Climbs with confidence
- Runs easily and stops smoothly
- Pedals a tricycle
- Uses utensils to eat
- Turns pages in books one at a time

## Fun Activities to Try Together

1. **Story Time Plus**: Read together and ask your child questions about the story. Let them make up their own endings!

2. **Simon Says Movement**: Play follow-the-leader games that include hopping, running, and dancing - great for physical development.

3. **Pretend Play**: Set up simple scenarios like "grocery store" or "doctor's office" using household items. This builds imagination and social skills.

4. **Art Time**: Drawing, coloring, and playing with clay helps develop fine motor skills and creativity.

## When to Talk to Your Doctor

Reach out to your pediatrician if your child:
- Doesn't speak in short phrases
- Has trouble following simple instructions
- Shows little interest in other children
- Falls frequently or has difficulty climbing stairs
- Loses skills they once had

Remember to share both your celebrations and concerns with your child's healthcare provider during regular check-ups.
