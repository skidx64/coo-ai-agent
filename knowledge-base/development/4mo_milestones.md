# Your Baby at 4 Months: Milestone Guide

*Remember: Every baby develops at their own pace! This guide shows what most babies do around this age.*

## What Your Baby Might Be Doing

**Social & Emotional**
- Smiles to get your attention
- Makes little laughing sounds when you play
- Tries to get and keep your attention through movements or sounds
- Shows interest in faces and familiar people

**Communication**
- Makes sweet cooing sounds ("oooo," "aahh")
- Responds to your voice with their own sounds
- Engages in simple "conversations" by making sounds back and forth

**Movement & Physical**
- Holds head steady without support
- Brings hands to mouth
- Pushes up onto elbows when lying on tummy
- Can grasp toys and shake them

## Fun Activities to Try
1. **Face-to-Face Time**: Hold baby at face level and make different expressions. Wait for them to respond or copy you.

2. **Tummy Time**: Place baby on their tummy for short periods while awake. Use toys to encourage them to look up and around.

3. **Talk & Sing**: Narrate your daily activities, sing simple songs, and respond to your baby's sounds with your own voices.

4. **Play & Explore**: Offer safe toys to grasp and explore, ensuring they're too large to swallow and have no small parts.

## When to Talk to Your Doctor
Reach out if your baby:
- Doesn't respond to loud sounds
- Doesn't watch things as they move
- Can't hold their head steady
- Doesn't bring things to their mouth
- Doesn't make sounds or respond to sounds
- Seems overly stiff or floppy
