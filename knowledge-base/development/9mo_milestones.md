# Your Baby at 9 Months: A Parent's Guide

**Remember: Every baby develops at their own pace! These milestones are what most babies (75% or more) do by 9 months.**

## What Your Baby Might Be Doing

**Social & Emotional**
* Shows different facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised)
* May be shy or clingy with strangers
* Responds to their name when called
* Notices when you leave the room
* Enjoys peek-a-boo games
* Forms attachments to familiar people and toys

**Movement & Physical**
* Sits without support
* Can get into sitting position by themselves
* Pulls up to stand while holding furniture
* Crawls forwards using hands and knees
* Passes toys from one hand to the other

**Communication & Language**
* Makes different sounds like "bababa" or "mamama"
* Points at things they want
* Follows simple directions ("Come here")
* Responds to simple words like "no" or "bye-bye"

## Fun Activities to Try

1. **Play peek-a-boo**: Hide behind furniture or your hands to encourage social interaction
2. **Create an obstacle course**: Use pillows and soft items for crawling practice
3. **Name everyday objects**: Point to and name items during daily routines
4. **Read together**: Look at picture books and name what you see

## When to Talk to Your Doctor
Reach out to your pediatrician if your baby:
* Doesn't respond to their name
* Doesn't sit without support
* Doesn't make sounds to communicate
* Shows no interest in games like peek-a-boo
* Doesn't look where you point

Don't wait to share any concerns about your baby's development with your healthcare provider. Early intervention can make a positive difference!
