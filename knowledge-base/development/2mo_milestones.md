# Your Baby at 2 Months: Milestone Guide

*Remember: Every baby develops at their own pace! This guide shows what most babies do around this age.*

## What Your Baby Might Be Doing

### Social & Emotional
* Smiles in response to your voice or face
* Calms down when held or spoken to
* Shows excitement when seeing familiar faces
* Begins to express different feelings beyond crying

### Physical & Movement
* Holds head up briefly during tummy time
* Makes smoother movements with arms and legs
* Begins to open and close hands
* Brings hands toward face

### Communication & Language
* Makes soft sounds besides crying
* Responds to loud noises
* Shows interest in faces
* Begins cooing and gurgling

## Fun Activities to Try
1. **Tummy Time**: Place baby on their tummy for short periods while awake to strengthen neck muscles. Stay close and make it fun!

2. **Face-to-Face Time**: Hold your face about 12 inches from baby's face, smile, and talk softly. This helps with social development and bonding.

3. **Gentle Play**: Hold toys within their sight and slowly move them side to side, helping your baby practice focusing their eyes.

4. **Talk & Sing**: Narrate your daily activities and sing simple songs. Your baby loves your voice!

## When to Talk to Your Doctor
Discuss with your pediatrician if your baby:
* Doesn't respond to loud sounds
* Doesn't watch things as they move
* Doesn't smile at people
* Doesn't bring hands to mouth
* Can't hold head up at all when pushing up during tummy time

Remember to share both your celebrations and concerns with your healthcare provider. They're your best partner in supporting your baby's development.
