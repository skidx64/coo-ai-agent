*Remember: Every baby develops at their own pace! This guide shows what most babies do around their first birthday.*

## What Your Baby Might Be Doing

### Social & Emotional
- Plays interactive games like peek-a-boo and pat-a-cake
- Shows favorite people special affection
- May be shy around strangers
- Enjoys copying others during play

### Communication & Language
- Says "mama," "dada," or other special names
- Understands and briefly pauses when hearing "no"
- Waves "bye-bye"
- Uses simple gestures to communicate needs

### Physical Development
- Pulls up to stand
- Takes a few steps, possibly walking with support
- Picks up small objects using thumb and pointer finger
- Tries to use objects the right way (brush for hair, cup for drinking)

## Fun Activities to Try
1. **Read Together**: Share simple picture books and name objects you see
2. **Play & Move**: Roll balls back and forth, create safe spaces for crawling and cruising
3. **Daily Tasks**: Let baby help with simple tasks like holding a spoon or putting toys in a basket
4. **Music Time**: Sing songs with gestures and encourage dancing

## When to Talk to Your Doctor
Reach out if your baby:
- Doesn't crawl or stand with support
- Doesn't use simple gestures like waving

*Remember to share your questions and concerns with your child's healthcare provider at every visit.*
