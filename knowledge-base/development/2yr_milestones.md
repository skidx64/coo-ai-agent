# Your 2-Year-Old's Development: A Parent's Guide

**Remember: Every baby develops at their own unique pace! This guide shows what most (75% or more) children do around age 2.**

## What Your Little One Might Be Doing

### Social & Emotional
* Shows concern when others are upset (might pause or look sad)
* Looks to parents' faces for cues in new situations
* Starting to play alongside other children
* Becoming more independent in familiar settings

### Communication & Language
* Points to objects when asked (like pictures in books)
* Uses several single words
* Follows simple directions
* Starts combining two words together

### Physical Development
* Walks steadily
* Begins to run and climb
* Can kick a ball
* Helps with dressing (pulls off some clothes)
* Uses spoons and scribbles with crayons

## Fun Activities to Try Together

1. **Reading Time**: Point to and name pictures in books, asking your child "Where is the...?"
2. **Movement Games**: Dance together, play follow-the-leader, or kick balls back and forth
3. **Pretend Play**: Use toy phones, play kitchen items, or stuffed animals to encourage imagination
4. **Art Time**: Offer large crayons and paper for scribbling (supervise to prevent wall artwork!)

## When to Talk to Your Doctor

Discuss with your pediatrician if your child:
* Doesn't use at least 15 words
* Doesn't copy actions or words
* Doesn't follow simple instructions
* Loses skills they once had
* Shows no interest in other children
* Has unusual movement patterns or significant physical delays

Remember that early support makes a big difference! If you have concerns, don't wait - talk with your child's doctor about your observations.
