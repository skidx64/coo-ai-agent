*Remember: Every child develops at their own unique pace. This guide describes typical milestones most children reach around age 4.*

## What Your Child Might Be Doing

**Social & Emotional**
- Uses imagination during play (pretends to be a teacher or superhero)
- Seeks out other children to play with
- Shows empathy by comforting upset friends
- Takes turns and shares (most of the time)

**Physical Development**
- Catches bouncing balls
- Pours drinks and cuts food with supervision
- Uses scissors to cut paper
- Draws simple shapes and people
- Can hop on one foot

**Language & Communication**
- Tells stories that stick to a topic
- Speaks clearly enough for strangers to understand
- Uses complete sentences
- Follows multi-step instructions
- Answers simple questions about stories

## Fun Activities to Try Together
1. **Imaginative Play**: Set up pretend scenarios like "restaurant" or "school" using household items
2. **Arts & Crafts**: Practice cutting, drawing, and coloring together
3. **Active Games**: Play catch, hop-scotch, or follow-the-leader
4. **Storytelling**: Read together and ask questions about the story, or make up stories together

## When to Talk to Your Doctor
Discuss with your healthcare provider if your child:
- Can't speak in clear full sentences
- Shows little interest in interactive games
- Has difficulty following simple instructions
- Struggles with basic self-help tasks like dressing
- Shows no interest in pretend play
- Has unusual difficulty with running, climbing, or other physical activities

## Remember
- Each child develops differently
- This is a general guide, not a strict checklist
- Early attention to concerns often leads to better outcomes
- Celebrate your child's unique development journey!
