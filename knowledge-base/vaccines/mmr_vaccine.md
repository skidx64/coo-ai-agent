# A Parent's Guide to the MMR Vaccine

## What It Protects Against
The MMR vaccine safeguards your little one against three important childhood illnesses: measles, mumps, and rubella. This single vaccine provides lifelong protection against these diseases, which can have serious complications if contracted naturally. By choosing to vaccinate, you're giving your child the gift of protection before they ever encounter these viruses.

## When It's Given
Your baby will receive two doses of the MMR vaccine:
- First dose: 12-15 months of age
- Second dose: 4-6 years of age

If you're planning international travel with your baby between 6-11 months, talk to your pediatrician about getting an early dose for added protection.

## What to Expect
The MMR vaccine is given as a quick injection in your child's thigh or upper arm. Like all vaccines, your little one might experience some mild reactions that show their body is building protection:
- Mild fever (common 6-12 days after shot)
- Light rash (about 7-14 days after shot)
- Slightly swollen glands
- Temporary soreness at injection site
- Mild fussiness

## How to Care for Your Baby After
Keep your little one comfortable with these simple steps:
- Offer extra cuddles and comfort
- Use a cool, damp cloth on the injection site if sore
- Dress your baby in lightweight, comfortable clothes
- Offer plenty of fluids
- If needed, give acetaminophen or ibuprofen (check with your doctor for proper dosing)

## When to Call the Doctor
While serious reactions are very rare, contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- High fever (over 104Â°F)
- Unusual crying or inconsolable fussiness lasting over 3 hours
- Signs of an allergic reaction such as:
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Wheezing
  - Fast heartbeat
  - Dizziness
  - Swelling of face or throat
  - Hives

Remember: The brief discomfort of vaccination is much milder than the diseases it prevents. You're making a smart choice to protect your child and contribute to the health of your community. Your pediatrician is always there to answer any questions or concerns you might have about vaccines.
