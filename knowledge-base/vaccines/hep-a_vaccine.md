# Parent's Guide to the Hepatitis A Vaccine

## What It Protects Against
The Hepatitis A vaccine protects your child against a serious liver infection that can make people very sick. While this disease has become less common thanks to vaccination, it's still important to protect your little one, especially since young children often don't show symptoms but can still spread the virus to others.

## When It's Given
* First dose: Between 12-23 months of age
* Second dose: At least 6 months after the first dose
* Special circumstances: If traveling internationally, babies 6-11 months may receive an early dose

## What to Expect
The Hepatitis A vaccine is given as a shot in the thigh (for babies) or upper arm (for older children). Like other vaccines, your little one might experience:
* Soreness or redness where the shot was given
* Mild fatigue or sleepiness
* Slight fever
* Decreased appetite

These reactions are normal signs that your child's body is building protection and typically last only a day or two.

## How to Care for Your Baby After
To help your little one feel more comfortable:
* Offer plenty of cuddles and comfort
* Use a clean, cool compress on the injection site to reduce soreness
* Dress your baby in loose, comfortable clothing
* Make sure they get plenty of fluids
* If needed, you can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen (for children over 6 months) to reduce discomfort or fever - check with your healthcare provider for the correct dosage

## When to Call the Doctor
While serious reactions are very rare, contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
* A fever higher than 104°F (40°C)
* Crying for more than 3 hours without being able to comfort your baby
* Unusual limpness or extreme sleepiness
* Severe swelling or redness extending beyond the injection site
* Signs of a severe allergic reaction such as:
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Rapid heartbeat
  - Dizziness
  - Hives or severe rash
  - Swelling of face or throat
  
Remember: Most children handle this vaccine very well, and any mild reactions are far less serious than the disease itself. You're making a great choice to protect your child's health!
