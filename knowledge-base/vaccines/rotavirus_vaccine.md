# Parent's Guide to the Rotavirus Vaccine

Dear Parents,

Protecting your little one from serious illness is one of your most important jobs. Here's what you need to know about the rotavirus vaccine, which helps keep babies safe from severe stomach bugs.

## What It Protects Against
Rotavirus is a common illness that can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in babies and young children. Without protection, these symptoms can lead to dangerous dehydration, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The vaccine prevents most severe cases of rotavirus infection.

## When It's Given
Your baby will need either 2 or 3 doses, depending on the vaccine brand your doctor uses. The first dose must be given before 15 weeks of age, and all doses must be completed by 8 months. Your pediatrician will help schedule these at the right times.

## What to Expect
Unlike most vaccines, the rotavirus vaccine is given as gentle oral drops, not as a shot. Your baby will simply swallow the liquid, making it one of the easier vaccines to receive.

Normal, mild reactions might include:
- Temporary fussiness
- Mild diarrhea
- Light vomiting
- Slight fever

These typically pass quickly and are signs that your baby's body is building protection.

## How to Care for Your Baby After
- Continue normal feeding schedules
- Offer extra cuddles and comfort
- Keep your baby hydrated with normal feedings
- Use fever reducers (like infant acetaminophen) only if recommended by your doctor
- Maintain regular diaper changes and gentle cleaning

## When to Call the Doctor
While serious reactions are very rare, contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- Unusual crying or inconsolable fussiness
- Severe stomach pain
- Signs of dehydration (fewer wet diapers, dry mouth, no tears when crying)
- Any unusual swelling or severe vomiting
- Episodes of drawing knees to chest with crying
- Any behaviors that worry you as a parent

Remember: You know your baby best. If something doesn't seem right, it's always okay to call your healthcare provider for advice.

Trust your instincts, and take comfort in knowing that millions of babies have safely received this vaccine, protecting them from a potentially serious illness.
