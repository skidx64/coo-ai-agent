# Parent's Guide to the IPV (Polio) Vaccine

## What It Protects Against
The IPV vaccine safeguards your baby against polio, a serious illness that can cause paralysis and affect the nervous system. While polio has been eliminated in the United States thanks to vaccination, protecting your baby helps keep our community safe and prevents the disease from returning.

## When It's Given
Your baby will receive the IPV vaccine in a series of 4 doses:
- 2 months of age
- 4 months of age
- 6-18 months of age
- 4-6 years of age

## What to Expect
The IPV vaccine is given as a quick injection in your baby's thigh (for infants) or arm (for older children). It can be given alone or combined with other routine vaccines to reduce the total number of shots your child needs.

Common reactions that are completely normal include:
- Mild soreness at the injection site
- Slight redness
- Temporary fussiness
- Low-grade fever

## How to Care for Your Baby After
To help your little one feel more comfortable:
- Gently apply a clean, cool washcloth to the injection site
- Give extra cuddles and attention
- Offer plenty of fluids
- Move the vaccinated arm or leg gently to reduce soreness

If your baby develops a fever, acetaminophen or ibuprofen (for babies over 6 months) is fine to use. Always check with your healthcare provider for the correct dosage based on your baby's weight.

## When to Call the Doctor
While serious reactions are extremely rare, contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- A high fever (over 104Â°F)
- Unusual crying that lasts for more than 3 hours
- Signs of an allergic reaction such as:
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Rapid heartbeat
  - Dizziness
  - Swelling of the face or throat
  - Hives or rash spreading beyond the injection site

Remember: The temporary discomfort of vaccination is far outweighed by the protection it provides your baby against this serious disease. Your decision to vaccinate helps keep not just your baby safe, but also helps protect vulnerable members of our community.
