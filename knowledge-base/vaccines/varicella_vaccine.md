# A Parent's Guide to the Chickenpox (Varicella) Vaccine

## What It Protects Against
The varicella vaccine protects your child against chickenpox, a common childhood illness that causes an itchy rash and fever. While chickenpox is usually mild, getting vaccinated helps prevent more serious complications and provides lifelong protection when your child receives both recommended doses.

## When It's Given
Your little one will receive two doses of the vaccine:
- First dose: 12-15 months of age
- Second dose: 4-6 years of age

## What to Expect
The varicella vaccine is given as a quick injection in your child's arm or thigh. It can be given at the same time as other routine vaccines, and your healthcare provider might recommend combining it with the MMR vaccine (called MMRV) if appropriate for your child.

Common reactions that are completely normal:
- Soreness or redness at the injection site
- Mild fever
- Small rash near where the shot was given
- Mild tiredness

## How to Care for Your Baby After
To keep your little one comfortable:
- Use a cool, damp cloth on the injection site if it's sore
- Dress your child in loose, comfortable clothing
- Make sure they get plenty of rest and fluids
- If needed, you can give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for discomfort (always check with your healthcare provider for proper dosing)

## When to Call the Doctor
While serious reactions are very rare, contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- High fever (over 104Â°F)
- Unusual behavior changes
- Signs of a severe allergic reaction such as:
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Rapid heartbeat
  - Dizziness
  - Widespread hives
  - Signs of illness appearing several days after vaccination

## Important Notes
Before vaccination, tell your healthcare provider if your child:
- Has any allergies
- Has a weakened immune system
- Has recently received any blood products
- Is taking any medications
- Has been ill recently

Remember: Protecting your child against chickenpox helps prevent not only the immediate illness but also potential complications later in life. Your healthcare provider is always your best resource for specific questions about your child's vaccination schedule.
